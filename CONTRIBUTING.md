# Contributing to Krata

Welcome! We're very glad you're reading this; Edera is excited for all kinds of contributions! Please read the following to ensure you're aware of our flow and policies.  

## Before contributing

1. Please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which applies to all interactions in/with all Edera projects and venues.
2. Before opening an issue or PR, please try a few searches to see if there is overlap with existing conversations or WIP contributions.
3. For security or otherwise sensitive topics, please read our [Security Policy].
4. Ask questions! If you want to ask something, chances are someone else wants to ask it as well.

## Contributing Code

To get started with technical contributions, please read out [Development Guide]. If you're looking for something easy to tackle, [look for issues labeled `good first issue`][good-first-issue].  

## Reporting bugs and other issues

While it's totally fine to simply bring it up on our Discord, we encourage opening an issue on GitHub using the Bug Report template.  

## Pull Requests

1. For anything more than simple bug/doc fixes, please open a GitHub issue for tracking purposes.
  - Else skip to step 3.
2. Discuss the change with the teams to ensure we have consensus on the change being welcome.
3. We encourage opening the PR sooner than later, and prefixing with `WIP:` so GitHub labels it as a Draft.
4. Please include a detailed list of changes that the PR makes.
5. Once the PR is ready for review, remove the Draft status, and request a review from `edera-dev/engineering`.
6. After the review cycle concludes and we know you are ready for merging, a team member will submit the PR to the merge queue.
