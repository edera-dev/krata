## Reporting Security Issues

The krata team and community take security bugs in krata seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, you can use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/edera-dev/krata/security/advisories/new) tab.

You may also report security issues to security@edera.dev if that is the preferred method of reporting.

The krata team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
